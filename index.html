						<h3>About the Author</h3>
						<h2>Mama Judy</h2>
						<p>Judy Wright and her late husband, John, fostered fifty-five infants over twelve years, many medically fragile. In 2012 they were honored as both Oakland County and Michigan Foster Parents of the Year. Their work inspired the John and Judy Wright Scholarship for Foster Youth and the Judy Wright Volunteer of the Year Award.</p>
						<p>Judy’s debut memoir, <strong>Just Hold Her</strong>, tells the true story of a nightwatch that began with a single call to “just hold” a dying baby — and the quiet, hard-won mercies that followed.</p>
						<p>Judy writes to foster, medical, and faith-aware communities about presence, caregiving, and the courage to stay.</p>

						<h3>About the Book</h3>
						<h2>Just Hold Her</h2>
						<p>When the call comes to “just hold her until she dies,” a foster mother opens her arms to a child the world has already given up on.</p>
						<p><strong>Just Hold Her</strong> is the true story of that vigil: a quiet house remade into a lifeline, where medicine meets mercy and love learns to breathe between alarms. Told in spare, luminous fragments, it bears witness to the fierce tenderness found at the edge of life — where protocol ends, faith flickers, and staying becomes the bravest act of all.</p>
						<p>A memoir of presence over perfection, <strong>Just Hold Her</strong> speaks to anyone who has faced the unthinkable, loved without promise, or learned that hope sometimes arrives softly — in the simple act of holding on.</p>
						<p>Coming soon.</p>
