## About the Book

> *“Would you, please… just hold her until she dies?”*

That was the call.  
Two months old. Three pounds.  
We named her Jayden.

She arrived swaddled in hospital linens, tethered to tubes and monitors.  
Blind. Deaf. Insulin-dependent.  
Her hands and feet were raw since birth — the skin not yet her own.

They didn’t ask us to save her.  
They asked if we would just hold her.

**Just Hold Her** is the true story of a foster mother’s nightwatch — a literary memoir of medicine, caregiving, and the quiet mercies found in staying.  
It bears witness to the fierce tenderness discovered at the edge of life — where protocol ends, faith flickers, and love becomes the bravest act of all.
