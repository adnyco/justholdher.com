          <div class="about-body">
            <p>Judy Wright is a foster mother, caregiver, and advocate whose life has been shaped by the demanding, ordinary work of staying.</p>

            <p>She met her husband, John, through aviation. He was a flight instructor, a Vietnam veteran, and later a corporate pilot whose career carried him across the world. What bound them most deeply, from the beginning of their marriage, was a shared conviction that children mattered not abstractly, but concretely, in the daily decisions of a household. Over thirty-seven years of marriage, that conviction became the center of their life together.</p>

            <p>After raising four children of their own and navigating years of relocations tied to John’s flying career, Judy and John began fostering. What started as short-term adoption placements grew into long-term work within Michigan’s foster care system, caring for infants and toddlers whose lives had already been marked by instability, medical trauma, and loss. Over twelve years, they fostered fifty-five children, many of them medically fragile.</p>

            <p>Their home became a place of readiness. Bins were labeled by size and season. Bassinets were carried up from the basement in the middle of the night. Doctor’s visits, parent visits, and court hearings were woven into daily routines. Judy learned to advocate inside systems that often failed to see children clearly, asking the same questions again and again, showing up when others did not, and loving without guarantees.</p>

            <p>In 2012, Judy and John were named Oakland County and Michigan Foster Parents of the Year. Their advocacy helped inspire the John and Judy Wright Scholarship for Foster Youth and the Judy Wright Volunteer of the Year Award, created to honor those who offer consistent presence to children in care.</p>

            <p>After John’s death, Judy turned to writing, not to explain foster care or defend it, but to bear witness to what it costs and what it gives. Her debut memoir, <strong>Just Hold Her</strong>, is drawn from the spiral notebooks she kept during a two-year vigil caring for a medically fragile infant. The book resists rescue narratives in favor of attention, accuracy, and restraint, asking what it means to stay when outcomes are uncertain and authority is misaligned with lived care.</p>

            <p>Judy writes for foster, medical, and faith-aware communities about presence, caregiving, and the courage required to remain available. She lives with the conviction that while children may not remember every face that held them, they remember what it felt like to be held.</p>
