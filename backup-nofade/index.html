            <p>She arrived swaddled in hospital linens,<br>tethered to tubes and monitors.<br>Blind. Deaf. Insulin-dependent.<br>Her hands and feet were raw since birth,<br>the skin not yet her own.<br>Thirty diagnoses. No plan for healing.</p>
            <p>They didn’t ask us to save her.<br>They asked if we would just hold her.</p>
            <p>What followed wasn’t heroic.<br>It was ordinary. It was brutal.<br>Alarms in the dark. A thin-gauge lancet.<br>A quiet house slowly remade into a vigil.<br>Hour by hour. Breath by breath.</p>
            <p><strong>Just Hold Her</strong> is the true story of a foster mother’s nightwatch, a literary memoir of medicine, caregiving, and faith’s tender mercies.</p>
            <p>It stays with Jayden from the first call through the long nights that followed, bearing witness to the strange, aching grace where life meets its limits.</p>
            <p>Where protocol ends.<br>Where staying becomes the bravest act of all.</p>

            <h3>About the Author</h3>
            <h2>Mama Judy</h2>
            <p>Judy Wright and her late husband, John, fostered fifty-five infants over twelve years, many medically fragile. In 2012 they were honored as both Oakland County and Michigan Foster Parents of the Year. Their work inspired the John and Judy Wright Scholarship for Foster Youth and the Judy Wright Volunteer of the Year Award.</p>
            <p>Judy’s debut memoir, <strong>Just Hold Her</strong>, tells the true story of a nightwatch that began with a single call to “just hold” a dying baby — and the quiet, hard-won mercies that followed.</p>
            <p>Judy writes to foster, medical, and faith-aware communities about presence, caregiving, and the courage to stay.</p>

            <h3>About the Book</h3>
            <h2>Just Hold Her</h2>
            <p>When the call comes to “just hold her until she dies,” a foster mother opens her arms to a child the world has already given up on.</p>
            <p><strong>Just Hold Her</strong> is the true story of that vigil: a quiet house remade into a lifeline, where medicine meets mercy and love learns to breathe between alarms. Told in spare, luminous fragments, it bears witness to the fierce tenderness found at the edge of life — where protocol ends, faith flickers, and staying becomes the bravest act of all.</p>
            <p>A memoir of presence over perfection, <strong>Just Hold Her</strong> speaks to anyone who has faced the unthinkable, loved without promise, or learned that hope sometimes arrives softly — in the simple act of holding on.</p>
            <p>Coming soon.</p>
